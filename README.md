Customer churn (loss of customers due to competition) is a major problem and one of the 
most important concerns for large Telecom companies because it is more expensive to acquire a 
new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving. With intense competition in the 
telecommunications industry, it would thus be advantageous for a firm to be able to predict if 
certain customers are likely to cease their service since the firm may attempt to persuade them to 
stay through various means such as attractive discounts or packages. Due to the direct effect on 
the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop 
means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer 
churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main contribution of our 
work is to gain insight into the factors which have major effect on customer churn and to develop 
a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely 
subject to churn. In this project we will able to draw a feature importance graph and predict the 
churn value of customers based on the packages they select, their gender and other information.
We have used various data representation techniques for better understanding of the features also 
used Random Forest Classifier for the feature importance graph. For stable and accurate prediction 
we have used Logistic Regression Machine Learning algorithm.
